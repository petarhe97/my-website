# Personal Website v1.0

This project is created for displaying my professional experiences and interests in programming and also training my react and javascript skills.


## Future additions

- Better design, possible a one page scrolling experience
- Better projects list, animations during hover
- Resume page to include a button to a downloadable pdf
- Maybe changing the profile page to be a more horizontal experience after the one page scrolling update

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
